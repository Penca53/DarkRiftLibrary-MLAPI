To download it you can use [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DarkRiftLibrary-MLAPI_Penca53/) or [Mediafire](). Note: if you use Mediafire, you have to reference the .dll file in your project (If you're creating a C# app then you have to go in `Solution Explorer`/Right click on `Reference`/`Add Reference`/`Browse` and search for it. If you're using Unity, then you have to create a folder called Plugins and move the .dll file to that Untiy folder.
